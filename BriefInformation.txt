This is a basic blog template that had been developed with django and bootstrap. You can use this basic template. I am going to publish all source code of this website when I finish this project. Still you can use this source code as a template. 

To do list:
Comment function is ready but like function(to like a blog) is not, you may want to add.
Fix design bug.
Add redirect link for dropdown menu.(Only all tab works)
I have not started secure coding, you may need to add functions for security.


Enjoy, I hope you liked it...... :)
